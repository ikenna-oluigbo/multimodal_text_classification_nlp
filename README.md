# text_classification_nlp

We analyze a text corpus made up of thousands of historical tweets from X (former known as Twitter). 

We designed 7 different models, and compared their generative and predictive accuracies. The models include:  
	- Naives Bayes with TF-IDF 
  - Feed Forward Neural Network
  - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) 
  - Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) 
  - Bidirectional RNN and GRU 
  - 1D Convolutional Neural Network 
  - Pretrained models (transfer learning) - Universal Sentence Encoder and BERT.
